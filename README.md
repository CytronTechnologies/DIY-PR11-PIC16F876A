# DIY-PR11-PIC16F876A
Check in sample code of DIY PR11- Temperature Control System Using LM35.
PR11 is an open source microcontroller Do It Yourself kit. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to read temperature feedback from LM35, display it on 16x2 LCD, further control 2 brushless fan. It illustrates the process to configure ADC on PIC to read analog voltage from temperature sensor. 

There is 3 folder which are Source code(C and Hex file), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80)
