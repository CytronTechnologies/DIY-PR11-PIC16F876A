# Temperature Control System Using LM35.
Sample source code for DIY PR11. Project description : PR11 is an open source microcontroller Do It Yourself kit. This PIC microcontroller based project uses PIC16F876A to read temperature feedback from LM35, display it on 16x2 LCD, further control 2 brushless fan. It illustrates the process to configure ADC on PIC to read analog voltage from temperature sensor. Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code C, Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler and MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82 and XC8 compiler.
